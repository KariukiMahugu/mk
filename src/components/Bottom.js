                    question ='Are packaged travels the cheapest way to travel?'
                    answer ='"No."   The word "package" can be very misleading to people because all travel arrangements

                              This is done by combining your preferred hotel, stay and room type with the 
                              available flights, trains and land travels suited to your desired dates.
